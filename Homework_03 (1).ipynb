    "In addition to the supply and demand constraints sometimes transportation problems can have capacity restrictions such that each route will have a maximum number of units that may be shipped along that route. (Similar to worker availability in the worker scheduling problem.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem there are 3 warehouses that ship the same product to 21 stores.  The supply at the warehouses, demand at the stores, unit shipping costs, and route capacities are stored in the `transp_prob1.xlsx` file in the `data` folder.  Use the `openpyxl` package to read the problem data into lists and nested lists.  Once you have the problem data converted into dictionaries, then adapt the transportation code in the lesson to minimize the total shipping cost.  You'll need to add the extra capacity constraint to give an upper bound to the number of units shipped on each route.  Your code should also use Technique 3 to eliminate unneeded decision variables.\n",

For full credit you must use an abstract approach to the solution code and you should display the output in a nicely formatted manner (you could use a pandas data frame to display the transported amounts)."

    "Alabama Atlantic is a lumber company that has three sources of wood and five markets to be supplied. The annual availability of wood at sources 1, 2, and 3 is 15, 20, and 15 million board feet, respectively. The amount that can be sold annually at markets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 11, 12, 9, 10, and 8 million board feet, respectively.  In the past the company has shipped the wood by train. However, because shipping costs have been increasing, the alternative of using ships to make some of the deliveries is being investigated. This alternative would require the company to invest in some ships. Except for these investment costs, the shipping costs in thousands of dollars per million board feet by rail and by water (when feasible) would be the following for each route:\n",

    "Present your results for each option. Compare.  You should write a short summary of the results and include a recommendation for the best option.  Be sure to communicate enough that management can implement your solution including which shipping method to use when applicable. You could modularize your code, though this isn't required, by writing a function that takes the cost array as input and outputs the total cost and transportation amounts.  You could then call the function three times for each of the three options.  For full credit you must use an abstract approach to the solution code.\n",

These variables are then the demand amounts for the shipping from factories to warehouses and the supply amounts for the shipping from warehouses to factories.  With the extra variables the two F -> W and W -> S problems are pretty much standard supply and demand problems.\n",
