    "For the final project, we're going to combine concepts from Lesson 7 (Constraint Programming), Lesson 8 (Simulation), and Lesson 9 (Decision Analysis). We'll do this by revisiting the scheduling problem from Lesson 7. But, we're going to make it a little more true-to-life by acknowledging some of the uncertainty in our estimates, and using simulation to help us come up with better estimates. We'll use our estimated profits to construct a payoff table and make a decision about how to proceed with the building project.\n",
